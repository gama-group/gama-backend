# Gama-backend

Backend of the Software Engineering II discipline project

## :rocket: Getting started

# Technologies

The following tools were used in the construction of the project:

- [Node v14.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/)

# Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

# Useful commands

Install dependencies

    yarn

Run unit tests

    yarn test

Build everything (outputs will live in `dist/`-directory)

    yarn build

Start development server

    yarn dev

# Setting environment variables

For the application to work, the environment variables must be correctly configured for your environment.
If you are running locally, you must have the local variable:

    TYPEORM_ENTITIES = src/models/*.ts

If it's running in production, set the local variable to:

    TYPEORM_ENTITIES = dist/models/*.js
    PORT = // Where express will run. By default is 3333
    BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS = // How many iterations are used to generate the salt
    JWT_SECRET_KEY = // Secrect key for JWT
